# Link to svelte create below

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Svelte Project

-This was built on top of svelte-tailwind skeleton framework


## Svelte

Svelte is a .js framework, you can also use it with typescript if you prefer.
It's similar to React of Vue but I enjoy how the components are arranged and come together in this framework.
I think it's a little easier to read and navigate that the competition. Also works will tailwind much better in my experience.
